  <h3>Manifesto #2: Your audience is the primary focus: Intuitively guided, they should achieve their goal with least effort.</h3>
  <p>People are extremely impatient online. With minimalistic and persuassive designs we keep things simple and to the point. The effectiveness is measured in detail and repeatedly optimized using A/B tests. The result: a higher <span class="nobr">Conversion Rate.</span></p>
  <p>In other words; we give the right content to the right user at the right time.</p>
