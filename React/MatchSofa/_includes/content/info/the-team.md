      <p>Danish designer, Julian Jorgensen, was born and raised in Billund, the town
      where Lego first started, and subsequently both his parents were part of the
      design & marketing team at Lego—influencing his creative mind at a very young
      age and for years to come.</p>
      <p>During his many years of travelling in Asia, he became more and
      more inspired by Japanese design. He'd visit several Zen temples in Kyoto, and
      was in love with the empty rooms, the low seating, and the tatami mat flooring.</p>
      <p>As he worked & traveled he became an admirer of elegance & simplicity of
      Japanese furniture, the truth he realized is that all to often they’re uncomfortable
      —mistakes made by many others, function is lost in the artistic appeal.</p>
      <p>In 2010 he had had enough combining ideas from past present and future it is of
      no surprise that years later, he designed a modular sofa concept that is
      portable, multifunctional, simplistic, & comfortable for various types of people in
      various types of environments.</p>
