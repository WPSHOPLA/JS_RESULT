    <p>The MATCHA revolutionizes the livingroom making it a more Open, Zen, Modern and Functional space.</p>
    <p>It organically converts into a Ottoman, Memory foam bed, Bamboo table, Chaise lounge, workstation. That is all included in the standard unit. Additional add-ons are available to go even further. We call it Multi-functional.</p>
    <p>We've used eco-friendly products such as Bamboo wood, bamboo foam and Ramie fibre. These materials are not only sustainable, but also have superior properties of their synthetic/non-sustainable siblings.</p>
